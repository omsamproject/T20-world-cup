            <h5 class="mb-3">Early Life and Education</h5>
            <p>
                Ratan Naval Tata was born on December 28, 1937, in Mumbai, India. He was the adopted son of Naval Tata,
                the younger brother of J.R.D. Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. Growing up in a privileged
                environment, Ratan was deeply influenced by his adoptive father's values of social responsibility and
                philanthropy.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing his schooling at the Cathedral and John Connon School, Ratan went on to study
                architecture at Cornell University in the United States. He then returned to India to pursue a career in
                the Tata Group.

                significant challenges.
