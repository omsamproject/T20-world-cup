        <h1>How did Ratan Tata die?</h1>
        <p>The body of industrialist Ratan Tata was taken from his Mumbai residence in a flower-adorned hearse on
            Thursday morning, October 10, 2024. The hearse transported his body to the National Centre for the
            Performing Arts (NCPA) in south Mumbai, where the public could pay their respects.</p>
        </p>
        <p> Tata, the chairman emeritus of the Tata Group, passed away late on Wednesday, October 9, at the age of 86.
            He had been admitted to Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai on Monday, October 7, due to age-related
            health issues and to manage his blood pressure.</p>
        <p> Following Tata's death, tributes poured in from across India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned his loss,
            describing him as a "visionary business leader, compassionate soul, and an extraordinary human being."
        </p>
        <p>The Congress party also expressed its condolences, stating that "the passing of Padma Vibhushan Shri Ratan
            Tata, a titan of Indian industry and a philanthropist who shaped India's corporate landscape, is deeply
            saddening."</p>
